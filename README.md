## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have git installed on your machine to clone this repository. If git is not installed, you can download it from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your environment and start analyzing the Higgs boson's CP structure.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AHamamd150/Conditional_GNN.git
cd Conditional_GNN/GNN
```

### Step 2: Install Conda

If you do not have Miniconda or Anaconda installed, download and install it from [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) respectively.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment

This project relies on several dependencies listed in `environment.yml`, including libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, tqdm, h5py, scikit-learn, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, PyTorch Lightning, and Torchmetrics.

To install all dependencies at once and create a Conda environment named `higgscp`, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Step 4: Activate the Environment
```bash
conda activate higgscp
```
